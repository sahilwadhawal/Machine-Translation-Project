This repository contains the implementation of various tasks completed as part of the internship assignment. Each task is designed to explore different aspects of machine translation, natural language processing, and audio processing using deep learning models.

Task 2 - Beam Search Decoding for NMT:
Description:
In this task, I implemented beam search decoding to improve the quality of translations generated by a neural machine translation (NMT) model. Beam search is a heuristic search algorithm that explores multiple potential translations and selects the most likely one based on the model's predictions. This method helps in generating more accurate and contextually appropriate translations compared to simple greedy decoding.

Repository Structure:
beam_search_decoding.py: Contains the implementation of beam search decoding.
nmt_model.py: Pre-trained NMT model used for translation.
example_translations.txt: Sample translations using beam search and greedy decoding for comparison.


Task 3 - French to Tamil Translation with Five-Letter Word Filter:
Description:
This feature focuses on translating French words into Tamil, but only if the French word has exactly five letters. The model is designed to filter out words with more or less than five letters, ensuring that only specific words are translated. This feature is useful for specialized applications where the word length is a critical factor.

Repository Structure:
french_to_tamil.py: Script implementing the translation feature with word-length filtering.
nmt_model_french_tamil.py: Pre-trained NMT model for French to Tamil translation.
word_filter.py: Utility to filter words based on length.


Task 4 - Error Handling and Word Suggestion Feature:
Description:
In this task, I created a feature to handle errors when a user inputs a word not available in the translation model's vocabulary. The system throws an error message like "Word is not available" and suggests similar words. If a user enters incorrect words consecutively, the system lists all incorrect words and provides suggestions related to each.

Repository Structure:
error_handling.py: Implements error detection and suggestion feature.
word_suggestions.py: Generates word suggestions based on incorrect inputs.
log_incorrect_words.txt: Log file to record incorrect words entered by the user.


Task 5 - Dual-Language Translation for 10-Letter English Words:
Description:
This feature allows translation of 10-letter English words into both French and Hindi simultaneously. The model is specifically trained to only accept words with exactly 10 letters. If a word with a different length is entered, the system will reject the input and not perform any translation.

Repository Structure:
dual_language_translation.py: Script to handle dual-language translation.
nmt_model_english_french_hindi.py: Pre-trained NMT model for English to French and Hindi translation.
word_length_check.py: Utility to ensure the word length requirement is met.


Task 6 - English Audio to Hindi Translation with Time and Word Restrictions:
Description:
This task involves translating English audio to Hindi text. The feature is designed to operate only after 6 PM IST. Additionally, it excludes translating any English words that start with the letters 'M' and 'O'. If the audio input is unclear, the system prompts the user to repeat the input for better translation.

Repository Structure:
audio_to_text_translation.py: Handles audio input and converts it to Hindi.
time_based_filter.py: Ensures the translation is only performed after 6 PM IST.
word_filter.py: Filters out words starting with 'M' and 'O'.


Task 7 - English to Hindi Translation with Vowel-Based Filtering:
Description:
In this feature, the system translates English words to Hindi but skips words starting with vowels (A, E, I, O, U) outside the time window of 9 PM to 10 PM. If a user enters a word starting with a vowel outside the allowed time, the system displays an error message and prompts for a different word.

Repository Structure:
vowel_filter_translation.py: Script implementing the vowel-based word filtering.
time_based_restrictions.py: Manages the allowed translation time window.
error_handling_vowels.py: Handles errors and prompts for correct input.



Guidelines Followed :
Each task has its own repository with a clear structure.
The model and all necessary files are included, ensuring compatibility across different systems.
The tasks have been integrated within the broader framework of the course curriculum applications.
